# Base Network Model
A base network model for MATLAB is provided, where the user can expand the code to implement their own MAC and/or routing protocol. [MATLAB App Designer](https://mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html) is used to create this simulator.

## The app
In order to open the `.mlapp` files and change the code, the file needs to be opened with MATLAB. Once MATLAB is opened, make sure that the current folder is where the files are located and open the App Designer environment by double clicking on the file. The `Design View` is where you can add or remove components, and the `Code View` is where you program what the different components need to do.

> **This app is made for students following the course ET4388 Ad-hoc Networks 2020-2021 at the Delft University of Technology**
